# Jetson
Jetson is a generic Django project for a large range of different purposes. It shouldn't be used alone, but rather in combination with other projects.

Jetson 3.x is based on python2.7 and Django 1.8.x

## Requirements

Some parts of jetson depend on the following modules that you should install to your project's virtual environment:

- Pillow
- billiard (for celery)
- lxml (for tastypie)
- pytz (for babel)
