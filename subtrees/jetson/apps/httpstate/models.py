    Django provides full support for anonymous httpstates. The httpstate
    framework lets you store and retrieve arbitrary data on a
    per-site-visitor basis. It stores data on the server side and
    abstracts the sending and receiving of cookies. Cookies contain a
    httpstate ID -- not the data itself.

    The Django httpstates framework is entirely cookie-based. It does
    not fall back to putting httpstate IDs in URLs. This is an intentional
    design decision. Not only does that behavior make URLs ugly, it makes
    your site vulnerable to httpstate-ID theft via the "Referer" header.

    For complete documentation on using HttpStates in your code, consult
    the httpstates documentation that is shipped with Django (also available
    on the Django website).
