The original file is improved by adding the containing directory to python search path. This small improvement enables executing the script without cd to it.
Examples:
   python path/to/myproject/manage.py shell
   ./path/to/myproject/manage.py shell
   /Library/myproject/manage.py shell
   /Library/myproject/manage.py shell --settings=other.settings
It's useful for running sheduled tasks which can be integrated into django management commands
